While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was not very informative, stating simply "Unexpected token". This occurred intermittently and wasn't consistently reproducible, making debugging difficult. The error occurred in a specific component that involved dynamic data fetching and rendering. The component uses asynchronous operations to retrieve data from an API endpoint and then renders a list of items based on the retrieved data. It seemed to happen more frequently when dealing with a large dataset or under conditions of high network latency.  The code itself appeared to be syntactically correct.
